## 攻击

### 以太坊网络中的“DoS”攻击

>  What is a “DoS” of the Ethereum network?
>
> A denial of service (DoS) incident on the Ethereum network happens when there are consistently full blocks and many pending transactions on the network.  Recall that miners can choose to include transactions based on the transaction fee attached. If there are hundreds of thousands of transaction in queue (or as it is technically termed, the transaction pool) it can cause unusual transaction delays of hours. DDoS incidents can be **malicious** or **non-malicious.**
